# MEASUREMENT SET FILE/INPUT KEY
##########################################################################

# Key to define the location of input visibility data be staged,
# processed, and imaged by the pipeline.

# The pipeline begins with calibrated visibility data, which are
# located in this file.

# In this key, each measurement set is mapped to a target, project,
# array tag, and numerical tag. These are used to group the
# measurement sets together and stage them for iaging.
 
# The syntax for the key is space or tab delimited:
 
# Column 1: target name associated with the measurement set - should
# be defined in the target definition key.

# Column 2: project tag associated with the measurement set -
# suggested convention is the numeric code associated with the project
# by the observatory.

# Column 3: science field name - "all" is fine, in which case all
# science targets will be selected. If the field is not all, then this
# value is selected on during the staging of the data. Therefefore it
# should map to the field names in the measurement set.

# Column 4: array tag (7m, C, etc.). This is a tag that indicates the
# interferometric configuration associated with the measurement
# set. This is set by the user - that is, this is not a formal
# definition based on baseline lengths, it's a tag. We might change
# this in the future, but for now this adds flexibility for ALMA at
# the expense of someonus on the user.

# Column 5: observation number. This is just a nuemric flag indicating
# the number of the observation among other observations of the same
# target, project, and array tag.

# Column 6: the file name of a calibrated measurement set. The paths
# are relative to ANY ms_root directory defined in the master key.

# The targets need to map to the target definitions, and the array
# tags need to mesh with the config definitions.
