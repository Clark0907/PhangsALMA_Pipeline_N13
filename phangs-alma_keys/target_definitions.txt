# TARGET DEFINITION KEY
##########################################################################

# Key to define the targets in a project.

# In the ms_key each measurement set is mapped to a "target", which
# has an associated position, velocity, and velocity width. These are
# defined in this file. In cases where linear mosaicking is desired,
# this file should also define targets for the combined linear
# mosaics.

# The syntax for the key is space or tab delimited:

# Column 1: target name. This can be anything but needs to be used
# consistently across all of the key files.

# Column 2: phase center r.a. string. Used in imaging.

# Column 3: phase center dec string. Used in imaging.

# Column 4: source velocity [km/s] currently assumes LSRK radio
# convention.

# Column 5: velocity width [km/s] used for imaging and continuum
# subtraction and u-v data staging.

# Note that the phase center isn't the same as the object center. This
# is an importnat distinction mainly in the case of mosaics that cover
# only part of the object (e.g., the PHANGS-ALMA linear mosaic cases).
